# Meetapp!

### Instructions:

Meetapp, an aplication made with React created at the Bootcamp GoStack of Rocketseat!

First you need to make you "master" folder, my is called `desafio02` and inside of it you will make an separed folder for the app, `mkdir meetapp`. We will use this in the future.

Then `yarn init -y` to create a `package.json`.

The app will use:

```
sucrase
nodemon
ESLint + Prettier + EditorConfig
sequelize
sequelize-cli
pg
pg-hstore
yup
bcryptjs
express
jsonwebtoken
```

### Let's start!

First in your terminal install:
`yarn add express`

You will get `node_modules` folder and `yarn.lock`, remember to make a `.gitignore` with `node_modules/` inside it if you want to send for you repository.

Now make a `src` folder. This will be the main folder that will have all the code of the application. Next create three files inside the src folder: `app.js`, `routes.js` and `server.js`.
